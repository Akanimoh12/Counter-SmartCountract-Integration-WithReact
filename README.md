# React Counter DApp

A simple React decentralized application (DApp) that interacts with a Counter smart contract deployed on the Sepolia testnet.

## Features

* Connects to a Web3 wallet (like MetaMask).
* Displays the current count from the deployed smart contract.
* Allows users to increment the counter on the blockchain.

## Prerequisites

* Node.js installed
* npm or yarn installed
* A Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) with some Sepolia ETH
* Your Counter smart contract deployed on the Sepolia testnet
* The address of your deployed Counter smart contract
* The Application Binary Interface (ABI) of your Counter smart contract

## Project Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <your-repo-folder>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env` file:**

    Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project. This file will store environment variables.

    ```dotenv
    REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<Your Sepolia Contract Address>
    ```

    Replace `<Your Sepolia Contract Address>` with the actual address of your deployed Counter smart contract on the Sepolia testnet.

4.  **Add your Contract ABI:**

    You will need the ABI of your deployed contract. You can typically find this in the build or artifacts folder of your smart contract development environment (like Hardhat or Foundry) after compiling.

    It's recommended to store your ABI in a separate file, e.g., `src/contracts/Counter.json`, and import it into your React component.

## Running the Project Locally

1.  **Start the React development server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

    This will start the application and open it in your default browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000/`.

2.  **Connect your Web3 wallet:**

    Make sure your Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) is unlocked and set to the **Sepolia testnet**. The application should prompt you to connect your wallet.

3.  **Interact with the Counter:**

    Once connected, the application will interact with your deployed Counter smart contract. You should see the current count and be able to use a button to increment it (this will require confirming a transaction in your wallet).

## Code Structure Highlights

* You will likely use the `ethers` library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and your smart contract.
* You'll need to create an `ethers.js` `Provider` (e.g., `ethers.BrowserProvider` for MetaMask) to connect to the blockchain via the user's wallet.
* You'll create an instance of your smart contract using `new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, contractABI, signer)` where `signer` is obtained from the provider when the user connects their wallet.
* Asynchronous functions will be used to call contract methods (`getCount` and `increment`) and handle wallet interactions.
* React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks will be useful for managing the application's state (e.g., current count, wallet connection status).

Remember to replace `<your-repo-url>` and `<your-repo-folder>` with your actual repository details. Also, ensure your React code correctly utilizes the environment variable for the contract address and imports the contract ABI.
